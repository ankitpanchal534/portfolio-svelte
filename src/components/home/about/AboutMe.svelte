      Hi, I'm Ankit Kumar – a passionate Frontend Developer from India 🇮🇳.<br />
      I specialize in creating beautiful, interactive, and user-friendly websites
      using the latest technologies like React.js, Next.js, JavaScript and TypeScript.
      🚀<br /><br />
      I've been coding for over 3 years, and during this time, I've built several
      projects that have not only sharpened my technical skills but also helped me
      understand the importance of collaboration and problem-solving. 🛠️<br
      /><br />
      I'm constantly learning new things 📚 and love experimenting with the latest
      trends in web development to build innovative digital experiences. Whether
      it's improving website performance ⚡ or creating smooth user interfaces 🎨,
      I strive for excellence in everything I do.<br /><br />
